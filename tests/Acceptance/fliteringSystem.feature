Feature: Filtering system

  In order to view relevant listings
  As an user or customer
  I need to have a filtering system

  Scenario: Customer applies filters to refine product listing
	Given the customer is on the product listing page
	When they apply filters based on categories, price range, or other criteria
	Then they should see a refined list of products based on the applied filters

  Scenario: Customer resets filters
	Given the customer has applied filters on the product listing page
	When they choose to reset the filters
	Then they should see the original, unfiltered product listing
